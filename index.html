               <td>Fast food refers to food that can be prepared and served quickly. It can come from may places: sit-down restaurants, take-out, drive-thru, and delivery. Fast food is popular because the food is inexpensive, convenient, and tastes good. However, fast food is often made with cheaper ingredients such as high fat meat, refined grains, and added sugar and fats, instead of nutritious ingredients such as lean meats, whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Fast food is also high in sodium (aka salt) which is used as a preservative and makes food more flavorful and satisfying.</td>

Common types of drinks include plain water, milk, juices, coffee, tea, and soft drinks. In addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the drug ethanol, have been part of human culture and development for 8,000 years.</td>
